A simple calculator in Python using Jupyter Notebook allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes user input for two numbers and an operation symbol (+, -, *, /), then processes the input using conditional statements to determine the correct mathematical operation. The result is displayed as output. The program ensures error handling, such as preventing division by zero, making it user-friendly. Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive environment where users can modify inputs and instantly see results, making it an excellent tool for learning and experimenting with Python-based calculations.
